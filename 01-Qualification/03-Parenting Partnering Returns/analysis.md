# Parenting Partnering Returns: Analysis

## My Approach

It's much easier to allocate tasks when they're in chronological order. Therefore, the tasks are first sorted, with their original positions noted. Then, each task is sorted chronologically. The end time of each person's last task is kept track of. If the start time of the new task is no earlier than Cameron's end time, then assign it to Cameron; otherwise, check Jamie's end time. If the task fits neither's schedule, then a schedule cannot be reached.
